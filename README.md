# ComputerNetworks_I
Java Serial Communications Programming project for my University course, Computer Networks I.

 The code consists of five classes. The main class is the userapp which calls the separate classes depending on the request that we make. The possible requests are listed below:
 
 * echo request
 * image request
 * gps request
 * arq request
 
This class architecture was chosen for the development of the user application, in order to make validation and debugging easier. Throughout the project we communicate with the virtual server "Ithaki" to make the requests and receive the output data. In the reports included in this repository, the results for two separate sessions are presented and analyzed.
